#### Some history

- I couldn't speak until the 30th month of my life (~ 2,5 years old), my mom thought that I was mute.
This slightly affected my pronunciation ability as I grew up.
- At 8, in physical education class at school, my teacher introduced me and my classmates to a new sport named: Soccer with a ball on his hand. Then, I convinced my mom to buy me a soccer ball and started to play it every day every hour.
- I used to imagine myself as a striker and kicking the ball hard against the wall. When the ball bounces again, I imagine myself as the goalkeeper and grab it. I practiced alone like that.
- At 9, I watched the full Premier League season 2008/2009 and became a Manchester United fan. At that year, I also read manga for the first time. That is [Itto](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itto_%E2%80%93_C%C6%A1n_l%E1%BB%91c_s%C3%A2n_c%E1%BB%8F), an manga about soccer and it's still my most favorite manga until now, I still reread it from time to time.
- At 10, my father bought me and my sister a PC. I played a lot of offline games like [Bloody Roar 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Roar_2), [ FIFA2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_2001),[ Pokemon Ruby Simulator](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_v%C3%A0_Sapphire) ... and online games: [CrossFire](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFire), [ Audition](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audition_Online) but fell in love with [PES6] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer_6) and have played it continuously  until 15 years old. My older sister forbade me to install online games on our computer because they were too heavy, but I secretly installed and hid them in a private folder. 
- At 11, I was both selected to the school team to compete in the city-ranking contest for Excellent Students and the district soccer team to participate in the city-ranking soccer tournament. I decided to quit the soccer team in order to concentrate on my study. After that, I got the first prize of that contest and my soccer team also won the trophy without me. 
- From 12 to 14, I passed into the secondary school for the gifted of my city, I studied insanely for my parents pride. I continued play football as a passion and helped my class to win the school soccer tournament 2 years in a row.
- At 15, I chose physics as my major subject because  it helps me understand natural phenomena that occur around me. I passed into [Le Quy Don high school for the gifted](http://www.thpt-lequydon-danang.edu.vn/) - the most prestigious high school in my hometown. At there, I started studying for myself. I also discovered MOBA games and played them usually, mostly [League of Legends](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) and [DOTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients).
- At 16, I skipped many classes and courses at high school and instead spend time on other activites especially social activities and outdoor activities. Thanks to that, I realised I love interacting with other people. I was the member of volleyball team and athletics team of my high school as well as was the captain of soccer team.
- At 17, I focused more on studying and passed the National High School Exam with the score: 29/30. I'm quite proud of this :)
- At 18, I went to France and started my new life. In summer, I traveled alone from France to Italy and made a quite cool video about that trip. You can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auNcYnvzWIE).
- At 20, I applied successfully and received an acceptance letter from the National Chiao Tung University of Taiwan for an exchange semester. But I couldn't fly to Taiwan due to Covid-19 pandemic.
