#### Intro
I am a Vietnamese guy who was born and grew up in a beautiful city: Da Nang. After finishing my studies at Le Quy Don High School for the Gifted, I got a scholarship and moved to France to study [Computing and Information systems](https://www.utt.fr/english-version/engineering-degree/informatics-and-information-systems-isi) at the University of Technology of Troyes. I am also the president of VietNamese Student Association of Troyes.
<br>
I consider myself a curious person, always want to discover new things and understand what is ambiguous. I also enjoy working with others whether at work, study or sport to achieve a bigger common goal because this makes me feel useful. I like doing better today than yesterday.
<br>
Vietnamese is my mother tongue. Besides, I can speak English quite fluently, basic French and a little Chinese.
